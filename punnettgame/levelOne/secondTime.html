    <h1>SECOND TIME</h1>
    <p>Now you must help Howard Johnson solve another Punnett Square puzzle. He decided to challenge him a little bit more here, but he still needs your help, as he is not aware that he can solve an entire Punnett Square puzzle by himself.</p>

    <p>The game's difficulty will slightly increase in each puzzle, and in each level. Be careful!</p>
