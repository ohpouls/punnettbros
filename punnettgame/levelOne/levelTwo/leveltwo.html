    <h1><i>LEVEL TWO</i></h1>

    <p>Congratulations, you have finished the first level of this game.</p>
    <p>The game will now change. No longer will it be a text based game, but instead, it shall be an <b>amazing</b> interactive experience with actual graphics!</p>

    <img src="egg.gif">

    <p>Also, in case you are not aware of this, the game's difficulty will increase. Yes, it will. Very slowly. But it will. The animation above represents the game's evolution. Pardon me if it seems unecessary, but it is a nice little animation.</p>
